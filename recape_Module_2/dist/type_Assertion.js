    //     Type assertions
    // Sometimes you’ll end up in a situation where you’ll know more about a value than TypeScript does. Usually, this will happen when you know the type of some entity could be more specific than its current type.
    // Type assertions are a way to tell the compiler “trust me, I know what I’m doing.” A type assertion is like a type cast in other languages, but it performs no special checking or restructuring of data. It has no runtime impact and is used purely by the compiler. TypeScript assumes that you, the programmer, have performed any special checks that you need.
    // Type assertions have two forms.
